    "# Unearthing Nostalgia: An Exploratory Data Analysis of 1990s Movies on Netflix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix, evolving from a DVD rental service in 1997, has become a global entertainment giant. This project delves into Netflix's extensive dataset to specifically investigate movies released in the 1990s. As a production company specializing in nostalgic styles, the goal is to uncover trends, characteristics, and popular features of films from this iconic decade available on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to answer questions such as:\n",
    "* What were the typical durations of 90s movies on Netflix?\n",
    "* Are there specific genres that were more prevalent or shorter in duration during this period?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
